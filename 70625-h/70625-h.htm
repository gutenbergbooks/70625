<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_9">Foreword</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1 firstword">The story</span> of Plymouth’s founding has been told many
times, its simple details transformed into a national legend.
To reinterpret it and see it in a new light is difficult,
if not impossible. Yet the business side of the Pilgrims’
undertaking is a relatively neglected aspect, though Governor
Bradford himself devoted many chapters to it. The story has
several familiar episodes—the support of Thomas Weston and
the company of merchant adventurers, the break-up of the company,
and the efforts of the leaders in Plymouth to pay its debts.
The London adventurers have often been described as hard-hearted
profiteers, whose innocent victims, the Pilgrims, were
governed by religious enthusiasm and without any business sense.
We can understand better the real financial problems in planting
Plymouth by examining each one in turn. We must begin with
events in Holland and England and conclude with the payment
of all debts at the end of several decades.</p>

<p>The commercial affairs of this small colony have their own
importance, even if they are less acclaimed than the religious
and political experiment of the Pilgrims. They, too, reflect a
constancy of purpose and eventual success in mastering the
practical requirements of the first permanent settlement in New
England. Regardless of hardships, Plymouth held firm and survived,
whereas earlier efforts to colonize the rugged coasts to the
north of Virginia had failed. As a business venture, the colony
provides an early example of business integrity and responsibility.</p>

<p>Where does this venture belong in the larger canvas of English
expansion into the New World? An Englishman wrote recently<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
that the Pilgrims’ importance has been greatly exaggerated. This
is bound to be the point of view of the mother island, from whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
shores, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there scattered
in various directions a multitude of explorers, traders, and
colonizers. Compared with their total accomplishment, the work
of the small band of emigrants to Plymouth and of their petty
capitalist backers appears insignificant. To the American, on the
other hand, their victory over Plymouth’s starkness and meager
resources, together with the leaders’ articulate faith and common
sense, have taken on a symbolic quality which tends to
magnify their place in his early history. In fact, students both of
English expansion and of American origins find in the materials
for Plymouth’s history a rare opportunity to observe from within
the operation of one of the kind of small business partnerships
which originated many early English settlements.</p>

<span class="subhead">Financing the Plymouth Colony</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_1">The Pilgrims decide to emigrate to America</h3>

<p class="drop-cap o"><span class="smcap1 firstword">Of the</span> motives which prompted the founding of New
Plymouth, the search of the members of John Robinson’s
little English congregation at Leyden for an assured
religious freedom was certainly the foremost. If this had
been their only prospect, it appears that they might have remained
in Holland without persecution. They were dissatisfied,
however, with their hard economic lot. The most diligent labor
brought them little security even in the midst of the prosperous
urban life of the Netherlands. There were “fair and beautiful
cities flowing with abundance of all sorts of wealth.... Yet it
was not long before they saw the grim and ugly face of poverty
coming upon them like an armed man, with whom they must
buckle and encounter....” The university town of Leyden
proved to be “not so beneficial for their outward means of living
and estate,” yet they “fell to such trades and employments as
they best could,” until they attained “a competent and comfortable
living ... with hard and continual labor.”</p>

<p>Most of those who emigrated from Leyden to Plymouth, like
their friends who remained behind, were artisans; several performed
some operation in clothmaking. William Bradford, for
example, was a fustian weaver, Robert Cushman was a wool-comber,
and Isaac Allerton, formerly from London, earned his
bread as a tailor. Among the handicraftsmen were watchmakers,
cabinetmakers, carpenters, and makers of tobacco pipes. Of all
who took part in the Plymouth venture, less than a handful had
either the experience or capital to be a merchant or, as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
might call it, a capitalist. Edward Pickering, who did not take
part in the exodus, George Morton, and John Carver, who died
in the colony’s first year, were exceptions in having trading experience
and some means. Two of the leaders with a special
competence in theological learning, William Brewster and Edward
Winslow, were printers.</p>

<p>As they went about their tasks, respected, yet earning only
modest incomes, the members of the English congregation at
Leyden worried about their children’s future prospects in a foreign
country. The young men were “oppressed with their heavy
labours” and attracted to soldiering and other occupations
their parents considered full of worldly temptation. They also
dreaded renewal of the Dutch war with Spain. Deeply aware that
they were “men in exile and in a poor condition,” they dreamed
of a more satisfying life in “those vast and unpeopled countries
of America....” Some were eager to take up again the familiar
tasks of husbandry and looked forward to acquiring their own
houses and land. William Bradford, the historian of Plymouth,
asserts that while religious ideals were always basic to the founding
of their own community, an economic urge was also behind
their fateful decision. Pastor Robinson, on the other hand, feared
that in removing to America, his flock would “much prejudice
both (their) ... arts and means.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_2">They obtain a patent and seek financial backing</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The future</span> emigrants now had to make several decisions.
First, in what part of the New World should they plant their
colony; secondly, how would they defray the heavy costs of shipping
stores of food and equipment required for a new settlement?
By the time they sent two agents to London in 1617, they had
plunged deep into these questions.</p>

<p>Very likely the inexpensive contemporary pamphlets which
extolled the benefits of different parts of America helped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
leaders at Leyden to fix upon a site. They probably read, for example,
the descriptive brochures which the Virginia Company
of London had issued in connection with drives to raise money.
Robert Harcourt’s <cite>A Relation of a Voyage to Guiana</cite> (1614) may
have seriously tempted them to put to the test the fruitful promise
of tropical South America, but they were put off by its unhealthy
climate. Captain John Smith’s tract on New England
(1616), which Elder Brewster had in his library at the time of
his death, was consulted. Later, the Captain attributed the hardships
suffered at Plymouth to the settlers’ parsimony in using
his “books and Maps ... better cheap” than employing him in
person as a guide and counsellor. In the long discussions which
preceded any action, it was objected that settling too near the
colony at Jamestown ran the risk of Anglican religious persecution;
on the other hand, it might be dangerous to be far from
help in case the Spaniards, the persistent enemies of English
expansion, attacked their infant colony. In the end, “the Lord
was solemnly sought in the Congregation by fasting and prayer
to direct us ...,” and it was decided to plant inside the bounds
of Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>John Carver and Robert Cushman, trusted members of the
group, were the agents selected to approach the political authorities
and the Virginia Company in London. They had to negotiate
first the delicate matter of how much religious toleration
they would be allowed if they went to Virginia. They sought
help from influential friends in the inner circle of the Company.
Sir Edwin Sandys and Sir John Wolstenholme intervened with
the King and Privy Council to secure approval of a statement of
religious beliefs forwarded from Leyden to London. Sandys, a
leading colonial promoter, was treasurer of the Company after
1619. As a wealthy merchant, whose financial interests included
the colony in Virginia, Wolstenholme was often consulted by
the government on commercial matters. Even the good offices of
these important men were not enough to win the approval of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
royal or ecclesiastical authorities. Not that the King himself,
James <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, was entirely unfriendly to their plans. In a conversation
with his Secretary of State he is reported to have asked how the
colony intended to support itself. At the reply, “By fishing,” he
was said to have exclaimed; “So God have my soul, ’tis an
honest trade, ’twas the apostles’ own calling.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In spite of rebuffs, the agents from Leyden kept trying to secure
a patent for land from the Virginia Company. Crushing financial
difficulties had recently forced this body to give up underwriting
the Virginia colony by a single joint stock. Instead,
small groups of associates or partners were authorized to invest
in separate stocks for special purposes, such as selling supplies
to the settlers. Several groups of partners were also applying to
the Company for grants of land they meant to settle at their own
expense. In fact, a few such financially independent “private
plantations” had already sent over tenants and servants whom
they were permitted to direct. It was probably on such terms
that the Leyden group hoped to obtain land and to share in its
control until the investors were paid off.</p>

<p>At the time of their first application to the Virginia Company
the little band of emigrants were depending upon certain “merchants
and friends” who had agreed to adventure with them, for
the provision of shipping and means. Bradford’s obscure chronology
makes it puzzling as to who these men were. Writing his
<cite>History</cite> much later than the events he described, he seems to
place in about February 1620 the offer of support by Thomas
Weston they finally accepted, although Weston must have been
associated with earlier plans. Several months before, the Virginia
Company had already granted them a patent in the name of
John Wincob, but the discouragement over the religious negotiations
and the state of turmoil in the Virginia Company’s management
had made some people withdraw their original promise
to help. Meanwhile, two members of the Leyden congregation,
William Brewster and Thomas Brewer, were in trouble with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
English government for illegally publishing some religious tracts.
The danger of their capture was disheartening, as was the news
about Francis Blackwell, an elder of the English congregation at
Amsterdam, who had conducted a group to settle in Virginia.
Together with most of his shipmates Blackwell had perished in
a vessel so crowded that the 180 passengers were “packed together
like herrings.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_3">Some London merchants offer to invest in the colony</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Fortunately, </span>there now appeared in Leyden the venturesome
fellow countryman whose encouraging new proposals soon
gave a lift to low spirits. This was Thomas Weston, a London
merchant who had trading interests in the Low Countries. He
persuaded the congregation to reject the offers the Dutch West
India Company had made to induce them to plant in their territory.
He promised, instead, that if the Virginia Company failed
to assist, he and his partners would do so.</p>

<p>Weston had served his apprenticeship and been admitted to
the Ironmongers Company, one of the London livery companies.
A citizen of London, he was altogether a minor figure in the English
business world. He engaged in the somewhat hazardous task
of selling cloth and other wares to the Low Countries as an “interloper,”
that is, a trespasser on the tight monopoly the Merchant
Adventurers Company of London held there. Although not an
investor in Virginia, he evidently shared the fever which was
stimulating dreams of profit even in highly speculative colonial
ventures, and was willing to shift part of his funds to the relatively
untried business of shipping settlers to fish and trade in the
New World. It is also likely that he had some sympathy with the
religious views of the Leyden group.</p>

<p>For some years Weston’s agent at Amsterdam had been Edward
Pickering, a merchant married to a member of the Leyden
congregation. He had left England for religious reasons and enjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
a reputation for honesty and success as Weston’s factor.
Perhaps it was during a routine visit of Weston to his shop in
Amsterdam that Pickering informed him of the plans for emigration.
None of the leaders at Leyden suspected that in the
long run Weston’s conduct would not bear out the brisk confidence
and easy promises with which he soon persuaded them to
accept his promise of assistance. Indeed, in a short time Pickering
himself was unable to obtain a proper reckoning of accounts
with his employer without returning to England and suing him
for a large sum. Weston’s finances finally became so crippled by
debts, including those to some of the partners in the Plymouth
venture, that he left the country and turned to small fishing
voyages in New England.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This is looking ahead of our story,
however.</p>

<p>Weston had come to discern in the colonizing scheme commercial
prospects attractive enough to induce several other London
businessmen to join in an unincorporated company to send
the Leyden congregation overseas. Besides evidence to be presented
later that to a certain extent Puritan religious inclination
prompted this support, it is likely that the slump in the trade in
woolen cloth, the traditional mainstay of English commerce
abroad, was also a factor influencing their decision. The disturbance
in the course of that trade due partly to its reorganization
by the Crown in 1614 helped favor an interest in various new
money-making projects. In the rapid growth and dislocation
characteristic of early seventeenth-century London relatively
few merchants had heard of New England, but Virginia’s financial
difficulties were well known. Captain John Smith had appealed
in 1616 to investors in London and the ports of southwestern
England to support colonies to produce profits from the
fish and furs of New England. Fishermen, some sent by Londoners,
already were sailing off the coast, but Smith recommended
settling there so that permanent posts could lengthen the fishing
season and permit cargos to be prepared for the arrival of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
fleets in the spring. Weston and his partners may have regarded
the Pilgrims as the human material to carry out such a plan.
Perhaps he suggested planting further north than Jamestown.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, this promoter was welcomed with enthusiasm
when he came to confer with Pastor Robinson and to reassure
the discouraged that there was no want of shipping or
money. The next step was to persuade his Leyden friends to
draw up an agreement with his “merchant adventurers,” and
set forth in black and white the terms under which they would
receive aid and he could persuade his fellow-investors to contribute.</p>

<h3 id="sec_4">1620—Pilgrims and merchants form a joint stock company</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The </span>discussions in England and Leyden over the articles of
agreement were protracted. Robert Cushman, as intermediary,
thought he closed a hard bargain with the “grasping” merchants.
The terms of July 1, 1620, were not unlike those of other colonial
enterprises tried in Virginia and Bermuda. The entire capital,
including lands, was to be a joint stock fund, divided into shares.
Every person over the age of sixteen going to the new colony was
rated at £10, and £10 was accounted a single share. Any emigrant
outfitting himself with £10 worth of provisions was considered
worth £20 or a double share. For example, William
Mullins, a well-to-do investor-planter, who died in the first year,
left in his will his stock of £40 worth of boots and shoes, expecting
it to increase to nine shares at the end of seven years. The
adventurers who contributed only money and stayed at home,
and the planters, were to continue the joint stock for seven years
during which time all profits from “trade, traffic, trucking, working,
fishing, or any other means” must remain in the common
stock. Then they would divide equally the capital and profits,
viz., lands, houses, and goods. The common stock would furnish
food, apparel, and provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>A good deal of controversy arose when it was learned that the
adventurers insisted on harsher terms than those in the original
agreement. The assets of the common stock, it was claimed, had
not included the houses and home lots of the settlers, nor were
they to work seven days a week, two days having been reserved
for employment for their own families. The future planters had
some right here, for they were the full partners and not the
servants of the company. Robert Cushman, who seems to have
concealed the stiffer terms, nevertheless vigorously defended
them. When criticized by Pastor Robinson, who considered him
“... (though a good man and of special abilities in his kind) yet
most unfit to deal with other men by reason of his ... too great
indifferency for any conditions ...,” Cushman retorted to
Carver: “... what it is you would have of me I know not; for
your crying out, ‘Negligence, negligence,’ I marvel why so negligent
a man was used in the business.” If the disheartening new
conditions insisted on made many “ready to faint and go back,”
he could only say that the adventurers, other than Weston,
would have withdrawn their help if he had not altered the original
ones. With much irritation he objected to the “querimonies
and complaints against me, of lording it over my brethren and
making conditions fitter for thieves and bondslaves than honest
men....” Bradford suggests that Carver never forwarded this
heated letter to Leyden, but its indignant tone suggests the vexations
which fretted the Pilgrims in their undertaking.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The emigrants objected to the new articles and upon arrival
in Southampton from Holland rejected Cushman’s pleas. This
refusal, even though backed by their friends at Leyden and held
to until Cushman secured their adherence to the terms in 1621,
unfortunately embittered relations with the adventurers. Weston,
coming down to Southampton to see them off, “was much
offended and told them they must then look to stand on their
own legs.” Bradford saw in this episode the origin of the “discontent”
which later developed between the planters and their
chief financial backer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<h3 id="sec_5">Despite difficulties and controversy, the colonists set sail</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The preparation</span> of the voyage presented practical problems
the Pilgrims were ill equipped to solve. The small number
who sold their Leyden property to convert it into shipping and
stores, had no experience along this line, and their ineptitude
made Mr. Weston “merry with our endeavours about buying a
ship....” Edward Pickering was the most knowledgeable of
them in trade, but his money was not forthcoming, even though
Cushman and Weston had expected him to furnish “many hundred
pounds.” Pastor Robinson gave voice to pained surprise
when he discovered that at the time his flock had turned over the
money raised from their scanty possessions, Weston still withheld
his own money and had taken absolutely no steps to provide
shipping.</p>

<p>The preparations in England bogged down while three purchasing
agents scattered their efforts to round up supplies,
Cushman in London and Kent, and Carver and Christopher
Martin at Southampton. Martin was an Essex man, a newcomer
chosen to represent the “strangers” from Essex and London
whom the adventurers had recruited to swell the ranks of the
planters. He had taken part in settling the terms and was charged
with keeping track of matters at Southampton. This was a poor
choice, for Martin insulted the Leyden people, whose ways he
probably despised. When Cushman later called for an accounting
and took up cudgels for the complainers, Martin called them
“froward and waspish, discontented people.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In spite of all the “clamours and jangling” about the business
end of the voyage, there was one important accomplishment during
the few anxious months before the <i>Mayflower</i> (180 tons) and
the <i>Speedwell</i> (60 tons) sailed from Southampton on August 5,
1620. Between £1200 and £1600 was raised to cover the expedition’s
costs. Carver spent £700 of this at Southampton. Unfortunately
we do not know how much was supplied by any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
investor. The £50 put in by Martin, Cushman considered
insignificant. £500 which the Ferrars, probably John and Nicholas,
prominent in the Virginia Company, had promised and
then, for some reason, withdrawn, is the only single large investment
mentioned. The amount John Carver furnished is not
specified, but he was credited by a later writer with having put
in most of his considerable substance. With seventy-odd “Gentlemen
... Merchants ... [and] handy craftsmen” subscribing
to the partnership, most investments are likely to have been
small. At the last minute the party had to sell butter worth £60
to pay off a debt of £100. They left port dangerously short of
supplies, a fact which, as Cushman predicted, added to their
hardships in the New World.</p>

<p>Their financial difficulties also caused a fateful delay in beginning
their voyage. The August departure date was already
too late to allow time for crossing the Atlantic and building shelter
in mild weather. When the <i>Speedwell</i>, leaky and overmasted,
forced the ships to put back to land, a score of discouraged passengers
withdrew from the voyage. The <i>Mayflower</i>, now crowded
with the entire group, departed from Plymouth, leaving Robert
Cushman behind to serve as chief agent with the adventurers.</p>

<h3 id="sec_6">Contrary to their patent, the Pilgrims settle at Plymouth</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The location</span> where the Pilgrims planned to settle, and their
rights to it, were directly related to their future livelihood. Bradford
says that when they first made a landfall at Cape Cod they
“resolved to stand for the southward ... to find some place
about Hudson’s River for their habitation.” One of the earliest
visitors to New Plymouth, John Pory, wrote they had set out for
Virginia with letters for the Governor to “give them the best
advise he could for trading in Hudson’s river.” He blamed the
master’s faulty navigation for bringing them to Cape Cod, where
the rough weather of early December forced them to decide not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
to go southward, but to select a sheltered site nearby.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This
turned out to be New Plymouth.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims carried with them the patent John Peirce, an
adventurer we shall meet again, had taken out from the Virginia
Company in February 1620. Realizing that it did not apply as far
north as New England, the chief colonists drafted the “Mayflower
Compact” to avoid disputes over the colony’s powers of
government. The leaders probably knew before they sailed that
the old North Virginia Company had been revived under Sir
Ferdinando Gorges as the Council for New England. His grant
had been authorized in July 1620 but was not sealed until the
<i>Mayflower</i> was at sea. If before its departure there was any discussion
of heading north, Weston and his associates may have
pointed out that later they could solicit a grant from the Council
in the Pilgrims’ behalf. When the letters with the news of planting
at Plymouth reached England the next spring, they promptly
secured such a grant. John Peirce was again named as grantee
in the indenture, dated June 1, 1621. Its terms permitted Peirce
and his associates to lay out 100 acres of land for every person
shipped over, and 1500 for public purposes. Besides giving freedom
to fish and trade along the coast, it underwrote the colony’s
authority to make laws. No boundaries were mentioned; a formal
patent was expected to specify them at a later date.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_7">New Plymouth struggles with hardship and debt</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">A successful</span> relationship with the partners in England now
lay at the heart of the welfare of the infant colony. Even though
some of the London businessmen sympathized with the religious
aims of the Pilgrims, they expected the investment of their capital
to yield a return, and that rather quickly. Promotion of colonial
ventures was new and risky. Weston and the later leaders of
the merchant adventurers had not learned from the bitter experience
of the large, incorporated Virginia Company that a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
time must elapse before any profit could be expected from a
colonial undertaking. They failed to calculate that even if the
colonists engaged promptly in trading furs or catching fish, their
initial task must be to build permanent dwellings and to feed
themselves and a fair number of women and children. They
knew that ships set forth annually by merchants had fished along
the New England coast for several years. These usually erected
fishing stages and sometimes traded for furs. They required only
a modest outlay by the investors in them and wound up their
accounts at the end of each voyage. It was much more costly, on
the other hand, to uphold a permanent settlement until it was
self-sustaining. When even the wealthy backers of Virginia and
Bermuda complained about delayed profits, the small group of
capitalists supporting the Pilgrims certainly could not afford to
sink large funds for supplies year after year without receiving
goods in return. At the beginning they apparently underestimated
the extent of their task and seem to have neglected consistently
the necessary provision for the Plymouth colony.</p>

<p>The urgency of sending returns to these investors pressed on
the Pilgrims from the start. When the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed home in
1621 without a profitable lading, Weston wrote a sharp criticism
to the Governor. He had been informed about how the high
death rate and short supplies had weakened the colony during
the first dreadful winter, yet he charged the settlers with greater
“weakness of judgment than weakness of hands. A quarter of the
time you spend in discoursing, arguing and consulting would
have done much more.... The life of the business depends upon
the lading of this ship, which if you do to any good purpose,
that I may be freed from the great sums I have disbursed for the
former and must do for the latter [the <i>Fortune</i>], I promise you
I will never quit the business....”</p>

<p>Robert Cushman, the business agent in England, brought
this rebuke from the partners in November 1621. He came in the
<i>Fortune</i> to inspect the colony briefly and to persuade the colonists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to agree to the conditions the adventurers had insisted on.
He returned at once to report his findings. The accomplishments
of the first year appear in the lively narrative, <cite>Mourt’s
Relation</cite> or <i>A Relation of the beginning ... of the English Plantation
settled at Plimoth</i>, printed in 1622. Cushman, George Morton,
William Bradford, and Edward Winslow compiled this little
tract to encourage the investors about the colony’s progress.
Although a bit rosy in coloring, it relates what Cushman found.</p>

<p>New Plymouth was situated on a good harbor with plenty of
fish and woods close at hand. The settlers had built a fort at the
top of the hill and common storehouses containing the first harvest,
the colony’s precious arsenal and supplies from England.
In the small, sturdy, frame houses with roofs of thatch, scattered
along the street running up the hill, lived the survivors of the
first winter’s illness and privation. Their Indian friends, Squanto
and Samoset, had helped them conciliate the neighboring
Indians and begin trade with them. William Bradford had succeeded
Governor Carver, with Isaac Allerton as his assistant.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Yet an undercurrent of discontent and friction <cite>Mourt’s Relation</cite>
did not mention disturbed the settlers. The system of sharing
equally in all the arduous labor and what it produced, was
one source of unrest. Upon the unloading of thirty-five newcomers
sent in the <i>Fortune</i> without proper clothing or “so much
as a biscuit-cake or any other victuals,” the most stout-hearted
had a right to murmur at the addition of extra consumers before
another crop could be harvested. A gap persisted between the
Leyden immigrants and religious exiles, who had ventured their
persons and savings, and the London contingent, some of them
merely hirelings of the company. Bradford himself wrote Weston
about being “yoked with some ill-conditioned people who will
never do good....”</p>

<p>Since these strains threatened the successful execution of the
conditions with the London backers which he had just persuaded
the Pilgrims to sign, Cushman preached a sermon the Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
before he left on the text, “Let no man seek his own, but every
man another’s wealth” (1 Corinthians 10:24). Urging his hearers
not to labor for self-love or self-profit, he said: “Let there be no
prodigal person to come forth and say, Give me the portion of
lands and goods that appertaineth to me, and let me shift for
myself.” No one must think of gathering riches for himself until
“our loving friends, which helped us hither, and now again
supplied us ...,” were paid off.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Certainly the leaders of the colony had not been unmindful
of their responsibilities to the adventurers. Cushman’s ship was
freighted with good clapboard and two hogsheads of beaver and
otter, a return cargo they judged worth £500. Bad luck assailed
them, however, in the first of a series of disasters. A French privateer
seized the vessel on its way home and pillaged the returns
they had collected with so much effort.</p>

<p>Even so, it is hard for us to understand why the Pilgrims were
forced to endure such bitter hardship, indeed, at times, virtual
starvation, for a period of about two years after the <i>Fortune</i>’s
visit. They were continually disappointed at the failure to receive
replenishment of their scanty provisions, yet they had to share
these with newcomers whose arrival they did not expect. The
explanation for these harsh circumstances is to be found not so
much in the colony as among the partners in England. The
situation was the result of three major events: the defection of
Thomas Weston from the ranks of the adventurers; a quarrel
with John Peirce over their patent; and the irreparable rift developing
inside the partnership itself, which was to precipitate
its final dissolution.</p>

<h3 id="sec_8">Quarrels develop among the London merchants</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Up to now</span> Weston had been the Pilgrims’ chief supporter in
all the business dealings with the London group. He had promised
never to fail them if only they signed the onerous terms required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
by the latter. Before the plundered <i>Fortune</i> returned to
port, this giver of plausible assurances was the first to desert
them. One reason probably was the dispute with his former
factor in the Low Countries, Edward Pickering. Near the end of
1621 Pickering left Amsterdam and broke off dealings with
Weston. In the suit about accounts connected with their Dutch
business, he asserted that Weston owed him hundreds of pounds.
A protracted legal wrangle, continued even after Pickering’s
death and after Weston had departed for New England, revealed
the latter’s word to be far from reliable. One witness claimed that
he heard Weston’s brother promise to give some kind of an accounting,
not necessarily a true account. Arbitrators investigating
the contradictory claims of both parties finally concluded
that a matter of some £200 prevented a settlement, but Weston,
stubborn and contentious, filed a countersuit against Pickering
for a bond of £1500. It seems clear that other adventurers for
Plymouth agreed with Pickering in this contest, since John
Fowler, James Sherley, and Richard Andrews, as his executors,
continued the case after his death.</p>

<p>Weston meanwhile had written Bradford that he disagreed
with the rest of the adventurers over their course of action, reproaching
them for their “parsimony” in waiting for favorable
receipts before they sent provisions. Then he and another stockholder,
John Beauchamp, sent out a group of settlers on their
own account as a private venture, entirely distinct from the general
stock. Weston’s men not only brought no victuals for the
colony, but relied on the Pilgrims to furnish them necessary
shelter and obliged them to dip into their own precious stores
of seed corn and salt.</p>

<p>Weston’s break with the company in London soon followed.
The adventurers held a meeting early in 1622, when the majority
agreed to put into the common fund what we might call an additional
assessment of one third of their original holding of stock.
Those anxious to go on with the business believed it should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
be hindered by the laggards, so they resolved to break off the
joint stock as soon as the shareowners in the colony should agree.
This report of a decision to break up came from Weston and his
supporters, but it proved premature, as indeed Bradford suspected
so strongly that he did not show their letter to more than
a handful of intimates in counsel. Instead, Weston got out. He
wrote in April 1622: “I have sold my adventure and debts unto
them so as I am quit of you, and you of me....” The company’s
reaction was that they were “very glad they are freed of him, he
being judged a man that thought himself above the general....”
Not unrelated to his coming in person to New England in disguise
and under an assumed name may have been a large debt
he owed the Crown for alum; a Treasury warrant accused him
of withdrawing beyond the seas with the purpose of taking his
estate after him.</p>

<p>Weston’s subsequent projects for colonizing and trading in
New England for some time created problems for the settlement
at Plymouth. The Pilgrims’ leaders more than repaid him for
his early support by receiving his men kindly and rescuing his
rival colony on Massachusetts Bay from imminent destruction by
the Indians. When the promoter himself arrived at their door,
virtually destitute, but convincing in his excuses, they fitted him
out with enough furs to begin trade again.</p>

<p>Master John Peirce was the next to quarrel with his fellow
adventurers in London. A member of the Clothworkers’ Company,
Peirce claimed that he once employed more than a hundred
persons. He was the merchant who had received patents
for the Leyden settlers from the Virginia Company in 1620 and
later from the Council for New England. He had helped negotiate
the terms of agreement between the merchants and the
planters. It was under his name that they held the right to take
up land around Plymouth. This had made him important enough
for Cushman to dedicate <cite>Mourt’s Relation</cite> to him. In April 1622,
according to the story Bradford told, a version accepted uncritically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
by many writers, Peirce secretly obtained from the Council
for New England a new grant, making the associates hold the
lands at Plymouth as his tenants, rather than of the Council.
The London adventurers objected and forced him to assign the
grant to their Treasurer, now James Sherley, in return for which
Peirce demanded £500. The impression is left that Peirce deceived
the company and that they were justified in breaking
with him.</p>

<p>Peirce, on the other hand, presented his side in a lawsuit in
Chancery against Sherley and the other New Plymouth adventurers.
It is unfortunate that the answers to the charges do
not survive. Peirce claimed an investment of £300 in the colony,
reporting that when the adventurers, “being moved by the distressed
condition of the Planters ... in that place foreign to
them and a vast desert,” wished to furnish relief, they couldn’t
raise the money. At the request of Sherley, Peirce then tried to
sustain the plantation by putting up funds to outfit the ill-starred
<i>Paragon</i>. This vessel, hired from Peirce by the adventurers,
sailed twice in the fall and winter of 1622–23 with freight
and passengers, chiefly women and children. When wintry seas
forced her to turn back the second time, Peirce said that, although
the adventurers had promised that he should not suffer
any losses from the voyage, contrary to such agreement, he bore
the entire loss. After Peirce was unable to refit his ship at Portsmouth
quickly enough to suit the adventurers, the latter sent a
writ from Admiralty to arrest him for £600. Under his brother
Richard’s bond, the merchant returned to London, where the
adventurers “made a great clamour against ... [him] for some
supposed unjust dealing....” They attempted to buy out his
indenture, ultimately succeeding in obtaining from Peirce’s
brother a £500 bond to deliver it. This compelled Peirce to sign
it over to Sherley; besides he lost the chance to recoup his loss
by another voyage. In spite of a complex series of legal maneuvers
(Bradford wrote that Peirce “sued them in most of the chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
courts in England ... [and] brought it to the Parliament”), he
was unable to regain his investment and reported that he suffered
such inconvenience and damaged reputation that he
emerged a poor man.</p>

<p>While John Peirce held the title to the Plymouth lands “in
trust,” he seems to have acted within his legal rights in his
maneuver to exchange the indenture of 1621 for a new patent,
but his purpose in doing so without informing his associates in
London and New Plymouth is not clear. It evidently so angered
them that when they found out they stubbornly refused to settle
with him and pay the £500 fee he demanded. They probably
were not unwilling to ruin him. Bradford, on the other hand,
gave short shrift to the fact that the <i>Paragon</i> sailed at Peirce’s
charge and clearly accepted the opinion of the adventurers that
God had directed her mishaps against him because of his action
on the patent.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_9">The joint stock company breaks up</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Meanwhile </span>the most active of the remaining adventurers had
determined to forget the fiasco of the <i>Paragon</i> and prepared two
vessels, the <i>Anne</i> and the <i>Little James</i>, to carry a “large and
liberal” supply and a contingent of passengers intending to settle.
Both arrived in Plymouth in the summer of 1623. A great
part of the adventurers’ hope for profit rested in the <i>Little James</i>,
a small pinnace built to remain in the colony for its use. Bradford
said “the adventurers did overpride themselves in her,”
for her troubles began even on the way over. Because her commission
allowed her to capture prize vessels, when the captain
failed to seize a French vessel, the crew became “rude” and
mutinous, claiming they were hired on shares for privateering,
and not for employment in fishing or trade. Before they would
sail on colony business, Bradford was obliged to negotiate wage
contracts with them. The <i>Little James’</i> first voyage to the Narragansett<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
country returned without success, because she was not
equipped with trading goods to match what the Dutch could
offer the Indians. A series of calamities assailed her; she lost her
mast, and later, through negligence, sank off the Maine coast.
The loss of this voyage and the cost of raising her came to about
£400 or £500. In the next step of her unhappy career, she was
seized on her return to England by one of the adventurers for a
debt owed him by the others.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Emmanuel Altham, the <i>Little James’</i> captain, himself an adventurer,
expressed the hopes of the English businessmen for
the little plantation. He had observed the efforts of the “honest
men” of Plymouth to “do, in what lies in them, to get profit to
the adventurers,” and he anticipated that fishing voyages, collection
of beaver, as well as of timber, were all ways of raising
their returns. Yet he warned those back home that provisions
for twelve months at least were needed to allow the settlers time
for building houses and making a success of these different
enterprises.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>New Plymouth at first had expected to engage in fishing, by
now the source of successful returns to many small West Country
merchants whose ships were cruising up and down the New
England coast and then carrying dried fish to market in southern
Europe. The colony’s most ambitious attempt in this direction
did, indeed, secure a patent for Cape Ann from Lord Sheffield,
taken in the names of Robert Cushman and Edward Winslow.
Yet the hope that the Pilgrims “could fall once into the right
course” for profitable fishing and saltmaking proved unfounded.
The first fishing season was a failure; the boatmaker died; the
saltmaker turned out to be incompetent. The colony almost lost
to rivals the fishing stage erected on Cape Ann. Even the title to
the land had flaws in it. In short, this ended “that chargeable
business” and added only bitterness to the adventurers’ cup.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The seven-year partnership between the London adventurers
and the planters at Plymouth, unless renewed, as once had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
suggested, was to end about 1627 or 1628. In fact, the succession
of blighted hopes and dissensions just described dissolved it
earlier. Several innovations prepared the way for a new arrangement
satisfactory both to the colonists and to their English
supporters.</p>

<p>After two harvests the colony itself had decided that the task
of raising food for the settlers would prosper only if it was separated
from that of earning profits for London. In 1623 a parcel
of land was allotted to each man to till for his family and to maintain
those who were exempt from agricultural employment because
of other duties. In abandoning the “common course and
condition” everyone worked harder and more willingly. The
food problem was ended, and after the first abundant harvest
under individual cultivation, the Pilgrims did not have to endure
the meager rations of the first years. The plots assigned them
permanently in 1624 became privately owned in 1627. Three
heifers and a bull sent over by the adventurers in response to
Bradford’s request throve and multiplied, so there was cattle to
be divided among the households when the general stock was
terminated.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The alliance between the London adventurers and the colony
began to crack as early as 1623, when several men arrived in
Plymouth “upon their own Particulars.” This meant they were
not financed by the joint stock and thus had no share in the land
or profits common to the company; they were also free from employment
for the common good. John Oldham and his associates,
arriving in the <i>Anne</i>, were the first. Those of the “particulars”
who accepted Bradford’s terms and stayed soon displayed
jealousy over the details providing for their inclusion as members
of the colony. The Reverend John Lyford, a Puritan clergyman
sent over by the adventurers, probably to restrain the Separatist
tendency of the Pilgrims, succeeded in fanning to flame
the friction smoldering among the colonists who held different
religious views. While Bradford’s scathing condemnation of Lyford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
is clearly biased, it must be admitted that the minister was
a malcontent and hypocrite, to specify some of his more mentionable
sins. He and Oldham secretly wrote letters full of disgruntled
complaints to the company about how things were run.
For example, the “particulars” disliked their exclusion from the
fur trade and the restrictions giving them so small a voice in
government. Fortunately, Bradford intercepted their letters and
held them until the elements of ferment gave rise to a public display
of the Oldham-Lyford opposition. The Governor skillfully
suppressed the dissidents, but when Lyford’s friends among the
adventurers in England heard about it, their distrust of the Pilgrims’
independent religious polity boiled over into indignation.
Other controversial issues, such as whether to send Pastor Robinson
to join his flock in Plymouth, coming together with all the
financial losses, now brought about such a gaping chasm in the
company that it “broke in pieces.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>One group of the adventurers, led by Treasurer Sherley, remained
sympathetic to the Pilgrims and wrote that they did not
care whether the colony yielded worldly riches, provided it was
rich in grace and walking with God. Sherley, especially, defended
it against the charges of waste and inefficiency brought by its
attackers. Perhaps he made allowances based on the same information
as reported by Emmanuel Altham that “the burden
lieth on the shoulder of some few who are both honest, wise and
careful. And if it were not for them few, the plantation would
fall, and come to nothing—yea, long before this time....”
Altham blamed the company for sending over so many helpless
people and for the fact that the planters had not enough “good
trucking stuff to please the Indians.”</p>

<p>When the dissolution took place, Sherley reported as the
chief reason “the many crosses and losses and abuses by sea ...
which have caused us ... so much charge, and debts ... as our
estates ... were not able to go on without impoverishing ourselves,
and much hindering if not spoiling our trades and callings....”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Even the faction deserting on the pretense of Brownism
in the colony, suffered from the same want of money which
was “such a grievous sickness now-a-days ... that it makes men
rave and cry out....”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He referred, of course, to the depressed
economic conditions carried over into the reign of Charles <span class="allsmcap">I</span>.</p>

<h3 id="sec_10">The Pilgrims agree to purchase the merchants’ interests in the company</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It took</span> two years of negotiations before the adventurers agreed
with Isaac Allerton to accept the following terms for winding up
the old stock. They signed them in London on November 16,
1626. Then, reluctantly but courageously, the members of the
colony known as the “Undertakers” pledged their own credit to
carry them out. The forty-two adventurers signing the composition
in London<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> consented to sell to their associates in New
Plymouth all the shares of the stock in the lands or merchandise
up to now belonging to them both. The “generality” in Plymouth
in turn undertook to pay £1800 in annual installments of
£200 each, to be paid at the west side of the Royal Exchange in
London, beginning in September 1628. The five merchants designated
to receive the payments were John Pocock, John Beauchamp,
Robert Keane, Edward Bass, and James Sherley. The
Pilgrims also assumed £600 remaining of the debts of £1400
which Sherley reported the company owed in 1624. How this
compared as a return with the original sums invested in the
plantation at Plymouth, we do not know. Captain John Smith
reported in 1624 that altogether £7000 had been spent, and it
has been suggested that £5600 of this was share capital, and
£1400 debts, so that in repaying £1800 the colony was giving
back to the London adventurers only one third of the share
capital.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_11">The London investors were linked by common associations</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">As we move</span> beyond the period dominated by the company of
merchant adventurers, how are we to characterize this group?
What was their usual form of business, and had they other
colonial interests besides Plymouth? Did they sympathize with
the religious aims of the emigrants, or were they simply indifferent
to them as long as profits beckoned? Captain John Smith’s
statement that Plymouth was financed by “... about 70. some
Merchants, some handy-crafts men, some adventuring great
sums, some small, as their estates and affections served,” is revealing,
but to discover answers to these questions requires
close analysis of the names of the individual subscribers.</p>

list of subscribers is a handicap, for about one third are completely
unknown. Thomas Weston, John Peirce, Edward Pickering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Christopher Coulson, and William Greene should be added
to the list. A little less than half have been identified as London
merchants, but their major contribution to the Colony’s support
entitles them to close inspection. John White was a Puritan
lawyer in London, while Emmanuel Altham belonged to a family
of landed gentry. Many names are so obscure that it has not
proved practicable to seek them out. It may be inferred, however,
that the nonmercantile adventurers included some with
background in a craft, such as that of the printer, Thomas
Brewer. At the time of the <i>Mayflower</i>’s expedition most of the
sponsors were relatively young and attained maturity during the
two or three decades after 1620, when some became prominent
in the City and in the parliamentary opposition to Charles <span class="allsmcap">I</span>.</p>

<p>Just as the threads in a tapestry vary in color, but the pattern
of the weave repeats itself, so with the detailed circumstances of
the careers of the adventurers. Most of those we know belonged
to one of London’s livery companies and were citizens. They
held company or City offices; some were listed in a particular
ward as wealthy enough to be noted by Crown officials as men of
substance. One rose to the important role of Lord Mayor. The
merchants were engaged in foreign trade and kept a shop or
place of business in the heart of London. The crowded, narrow
streets and lanes adjoining the widest thoroughfare, Cheapside,
or close to the river, near London Bridge, then “replenished on
both sides with fair and beautiful buildings, inhabitants for the
most part rich merchants,” were their surroundings. They met
to settle debts and accounts in the arcades of the handsome
building of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill or in one of the
taverns. The shipowners among them said goodbye to their captains
from the wharves lining the Thames, the famous waterway
connecting London with the sea. Some traveled on business to
the Netherlands. The members of companies could attend meetings
and feasts in a well-appointed hall, such as the Goldsmiths’
in Foster Lane, or on occasion one of the great banquets the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
Lord Mayor gave at the Guildhall. They worshiped in the numerous
parish churches, and doubtless others, besides Robert
Keane, often heard lecturers or noted Puritan preachers, such
as Hugh Peter. Sherley and Beauchamp, at least, had an additional
residence across the river in Surrey; others held lands at
some distance from the City. Like all merchants of their time,
they were apt to have connections with the gentry; Thomas Andrews
was himself knighted by Cromwell for service to the
parliamentary cause.</p>

<p>Thomas Andrews, in fact, was one of the most notable merchants
attached to the Puritan and parliamentary cause in the
English Civil Wars. Although not a member of an older family
of wealth, he succeeded in acquiring riches and a leading role in
politics and finance under the Commonwealth and Protectorate.
In 1638 he became master of the Leathersellers, his company. A
share in collecting customs revenue for the Crown provided him
with what was usually a profitable investment. Subsequently, he
served the City as alderman and arrived at the pinnacle of office
as Lord Mayor in 1649. At the beginning of the conflict with the
King, this ambitious merchant served on the City’s all-important
Militia Committee, which, besides controlling London forces,
was “largely responsible for organizing money for the parliamentary
army.” One of the committees he served as treasurer,
collected about £1,000,000. He helped manage money raised
for putting down the Irish Rebellion and by selling lands confiscated
from the King and Royalists. Andrews himself contributed
huge sums to the parliamentary forces. Both Edward Winslow,
a Plymouth colonist, and James Sherley were his fellow
members on other commissions, one to judge treasons against
the Commonwealth and the other to dismiss ministers and
schoolmasters thought to be “insufficient,” i.e., not conforming
to Puritan standards. In the later political struggle between the
Independents and Presbyterians, Andrews belonged to the Independent
party. It is difficult to explain in a short space how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
these groups differed about church government and politics.
Roughly speaking, an English Independent developed ideas of
religious toleration, self-government for each congregation, and
opposition to a state church, which were rejected by Presbyterians.
New Englanders, on the other hand, enforced the congregational
form of church government. It is probable that a
London merchant who had arrived at the position of Independency
by the 1640s would have sympathized earlier with the religious
views of the settlers of New England.</p>

<p>Andrews’ business interests were widely scattered in trade,
colonization, land speculation, and finance. He joined the effort
of the Massachusetts Bay Company to found a Puritan refuge in
New England; he agreed to lend it £25 and later became one of
a group of “Undertakers” who took over its debts in 1634. In
the 1640s he had a crucial role in financing new trades pioneered
by the East India Company. As a director of that Company for
many years, he was required to own at least £1000 of stock. At
one time he invested in a rival syndicate which traded on the
Malabar Coast of India; another of its schemes was to plant a
colony on the West Coast of Africa. Eventually, Andrews came
to co-operate with the Company and rose to be its governor.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
These varied mercantile enterprises, and they could be extended
into land dealings, suggest that the young Thomas Andrews was
induced to support the Plymouth venture by calculations of
profit as well as initial approval of its religious aims.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the religious bonds of the London
backers of Plymouth Colony have received too little attention
and their mercenary objectives have been contrasted too sharply
with the purity of motive of the Pilgrims. In the Massachusetts
Bay Company, on the other hand, it is acknowledged that the
investors shared “Puritan” religious and political ends inspiring
them to encourage colonial ventures. This company included
among its members nine Londoners who previously had been
adventurers in the founding of Plymouth. These were Richard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Andrews, Thomas Andrews, just described, Christopher Coulson,
Thomas Goffe, Robert Keane, John Pocock, John Revell,
Samuel Sharpe, and John White.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Let us glance at the background
of each and consider its relation to his participation in
both plantation schemes.</p>

<p>Richard Andrews persisted in a business career rather than
sharing the prominence of his brother in government affairs.
He remained interested in Plymouth even after 1626, becoming
a partner with the “Undertakers.” Thus, he certainly was not
one of the adventurers whom Treasurer Sherley described as
offended by the Colony’s form of religious worship. His enthusiasm
for New England extended to Massachusetts Bay. He, too,
lent it money and entered the syndicate of those who furnished
supplies after 1634. He was a member of the Haberdashers’
Company, a renowned sponsor of Puritan preachers. His business
was conducted at the sign of the Mermaid near the Cross in
Cheapside; this was a well-known tavern in Bread Street with
an entrance from Cheapside. Late in the 1620s he owned shares
in the ships <i>Rebecca</i> (200 tons), the <i>Jane</i> (200 tons), and the
<i>Roebuck</i> (80 tons), all of which received letters of marque to capture
pirates. Another of his ships prepared to undertake a voyage
to Massachusetts early in 1645. Most of his trading probably
was with the Netherlands, where in 1632 his factor ran afoul of
Sir Paul Pindar, a wealthy merchant who shared in collecting
customs revenue and was privileged to hold a patent for alum.
Andrews and the factor were charged with bringing in some
alum contrary to Pindar’s patent. In the 1640s Andrews spent
several years in Rotterdam, where there was a trading center of
the Merchant Adventurers; he may have been a member of that
organization selling English cloth abroad. Andrews’ search for
profit doubtless helped direct him to invest in New England, but
his gifts to the poor and to the ministers of Massachusetts substantiate
John Winthrop’s claim that the donor was a “godly
man,” consistently dedicated to Puritan causes. He even sent a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
gift to the Indians to be distributed by John Eliot and Thomas
Mayhew. This included “8 little books against swearing,” “3
books against drunkenness,” and “2 dozen of small books
called the rule of the New Creature,” all summoning up Puritan
themes.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Christopher Coulson was named in Peirce’s suit as an assistant
of the New Plymouth Company, but he had withdrawn before
the composition. While deciding not to participate in Isaac
Allerton’s investment in the Maine fur trade, he did become an
assistant of the Bay Company. Coulson was a dyer of cloth. As
one of the well-to-do citizens of Dowgate Ward, he served on the
City’s Common Council and, with Thomas Andrews, on the
Militia Committee.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Too deep an involvement in colonial ventures was likely to
harm one’s credit. The first deputy governor and treasurer of
the Massachusetts Bay Company, Thomas Goffe, sank into heavy
debt for a time, part contracted for Winthrop personally and
part for the Company. Goffe complained bitterly when, in a
difference with Winthrop, he received no payment. As a shipowner
with a share in the <i>Welcome</i> and in two other vessels
which seem to have crossed the Atlantic, he wrote that his shipowning
was far from successful in 1630, the year of the initial
Winthrop voyage. His affairs were “in an ambiguous and desperate
estate” until some of his creditors, pitying him, took over
part of the plantation debts and lent him enough capital to begin
trading again. Though he suffered financial loss from the Puritan
venture in Massachusetts, Goffe perhaps derived a greater
measure of satisfaction from his donation to another Puritan
cause. Along with a number of other Londoners he supported
a daily lecture at the Church of St. Antholin’s. This afforded
Puritan ministers and lecturers a platform for their views until
the government suppressed the society, known as the Feoffees
of Impropriations, which had been active in raising money to
encourage a preaching ministry in London and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>By investing in the Pilgrims’ colony, John Pocock began what
was a long association with New England. John Peirce called
this merchant a leader in its support, and even after the composition
Pocock extended it credit. Recruited as an officer in the
Bay Company, he continued his generosity to that colony for
about a quarter of a century. In fact, after Thomas Weld and
Hugh Peter had concluded a mission in England in Massachusetts’
behalf, Pocock succeeded them as London agent; he also
offered his shop in Watling Street, where he conducted business
as a merchant taylor and woolen draper, to exhibit their disputed
accounts. A fifteen years’ wait for payment of about £150
worth of cloth he had sent in 1641 to assist Massachusetts, did
not deter him from investing substantially in John Winthrop
Jr.’s project for establishing ironworks at Braintree, Massachusetts.
Pocock fully sympathized with Puritanism and the parliamentary
opposition to the King, as demonstrated by his contributions
to the St. Antholin’s lectureship and his inclusion
among the promoters of the London scheme to raise money for
troops to help crush the Irish Rebellion. Parliament next made
him one of the officials to whom were entrusted the Anglican
church revenues so that they might be converted to the use of
new Puritan preachers.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> John Pocock’s range of activities indicates
that he, too, looked kindly on Plymouth and Massachusetts
Bay as outposts of Puritan influence.</p>

<p>Three of the merchants who had subscribed to the Plymouth
venture, Robert Keane, John Revell, and Samuel Sharpe, actually
emigrated to Massachusetts. The first to come over was
Samuel Sharpe, who arrived in Salem as a member of the council
chosen to assist Governor Endecott and to serve as business
agent for the merchant, Matthew Cradock. In fact, Sharpe carried
over the copy of the Company’s new patent. Had Endecott
died, he was one of two designated to take over the government
of the colony. Sharpe settled in Salem and became a freeman
in 1632.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>John Revell’s part in financing the early Bay venture was
clearly more important, however. Not only was he an assistant
of the Massachusetts Bay Company, but he took a one-sixteenth
share in a large ship for the transport of passengers and supplies
to New England the Company could not afford. He also contributed
£40 for freight during preparation for the 1630 fleet of
vessels. He came aboard Winthrop’s vessel for dinner during the
crossing, returning to his own under the salute of a volley of
three shots. It is not known why he returned to England after a
few weeks. He must have planned to stay, as his wife and children
were with him. Back in London he belonged to the group
of “Undertakers” supplying the Massachusetts plantation.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The mind and temper of the final emigrant, Robert Keane, is
clearer to us than that of any other adventurer in New Plymouth,
with the possible exception of James Sherley. No career could
illustrate better the compatibility of a calculated design to add
to one’s wealth in the New World with the satisfaction of a sensitive
Puritan conscience. At the same time that he was improving
his worldly estate in London and Boston, Keane was walking
the paths of salvation, he hoped, leaving in the interesting document,
his last will and testament, a full discussion of both objectives.
His account books, numerous as they were, can hardly
have exceeded in bulk the handwritten ledgers he filled with
comments on Scriptural books and on the sermons he had heard.
In London, he laboriously noted in 1627 and 1628 the contents
of discourses in several churches, including the famed St. Stephen’s,
Coleman Street, where he listened to Mr. John Davenport,
and one at Hackney visited by Master Hugh Peter. He
attended some of the lectures at St. Antholin’s but most often,
service at what he calls “Cornhill,” probably either St. Michael,
Cornhill, or St. Peter’s, Cornhill. Between attending several
services a month and writing down what was said, he gave a good
deal of earnest thought to religion.</p>

<p>In his business career, Keane asserted that he was “self-made,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
with no inheritance from his father. After apprenticeship in the
Merchant Taylors’ Company, he took a shop in Birchin Lane,
a street where the sellers of clothing displayed their wares.
Either because of his fortunate marriage to the daughter of a
gentleman or, more likely, because of success in business which
enabled him to accumulate an estate of some £2000 or £3000,
he enjoyed the modest rewards of a prosperous citizen, such as
membership in the Honourable Artillery Company of London.
His routine business included supplying liveries for the pages
and footmen of the Lord Chamberlain. Keane was associated
with James Sherley and the other merchants who furnished
Plymouth with capital and direction. With Sherley he signed a
letter to the colonists in 1624, and Peirce mentions him as an
“assistant.” In the list of 1626, Keane was among the five designated
to receive the £1800 to be paid by the Colony. In the
Massachusetts Bay Company he was one of the inner ring of
“Undertakers.” Keane was also the leading spirit in the organization
of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of
Massachusetts. He served as the first captain of this military
company, the earliest to be chartered in America.</p>

<p>The religious pressures upon a conscience like Keane’s are
unmistakable, for amidst all the troubles he suffered in Massachusetts
he described the new commonwealth, in its closeness
to the Gospel, as little different from that which had summoned
him to leave England in 1635. Of those who came to Boston, he
was remarkable for his wealth and his successful application of it
to new kinds of profitable transactions, such as investment in
land and trade to Bermuda or the West Indies. In time, he installed
his son, Benjamin, in Birchin Lane in London to act as
his agent and to sell cloaks. Keane’s career is a model of the
intertwining of “merchandise, reading and writing,” all matters
of importance to Puritans anxious to redeem their time on earth.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Most London Puritans whose interests embraced first Plymouth
and then Massachusetts Bay were merchants, but one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
a prominent lawyer of the Middle Temple. This was “Counsellor”
John White, so called to distinguish him from the minister,
John White of Dorchester, another leader in New England
colonization. The lawyer John White became an investor in the
latter’s enterprise, the Dorchester Company. Many activities
mark him as a sympathizer with nonconformity, but his record
with the New Plymouth venture suggests that he was one of the
adventurers opposed to Separatism. While these were debating
hotly the treatment Bradford had meted out to Lyford, partly
for his use of the Book of Common Prayer, the faction favoring
Lyford chose John White to be moderator in their interest. On
terminating his interest in Plymouth in 1626, he perhaps was the
lawyer John Peirce chose to arbitrate in his behalf in the course
of his lawsuit against the adventurers. By becoming one of the
Lay Feoffees, a group of trustees raising money to support the
preachers they favored in the churches, White lent his name to
one of the most dangerous of the Puritan efforts to oppose the
policy of strict conformity insisted on by English authorities.
He attended meetings of the early Massachusetts Bay Company
and perhaps at one time contemplated emigration to New England,
as suggested by one of John Winthrop’s correspondents.
Remaining in London, he became a strong influence instead in
settling such difficult problems as whether the prospective emigrants
or the London merchants were to control the joint stock.
A friend of Winthrop wrote in 1640 of this consistent friend of
Massachusetts: “... there is so little money stirring to be
exc[h]anged for the Plantation and so many hands to catch for
it, that there is no hopes of obtaining any ... nor of Mr. White
the Lawyer ... it being disposed some other way....” John
White’s greatest service to Puritanism and the parliamentary
cause came when he was chosen to serve for Southwark in the
Long Parliament. There he presided over two committees, one
to replace “scandalous” ministers with Puritan preachers, and
the other to care for ministers who had been “plundered” by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
preceding government. A little of the affectionate regard in
which he was held may be observed in that when he died in
1645, the House of Commons accompanied his body to Middle
Temple Church for burial.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>So much for the investors in both the New England colonies.
What we know of the other New Plymouth adventurers does not
contradict the sketch set forth of men of moderate prosperity or
wealth, Puritan in religious outlook, and usually of some prominence
in the City’s affairs in the period of the Civil Wars. It
remains to discuss more fully the two merchants who, along with
Richard Andrews, did most to maintain the credit of the Plymouth
“Undertakers” after 1627. These were John Beauchamp
and James Sherley.</p>

<p>A member of the Salters’ Company, Beauchamp was an early
associate of Thomas Weston, with whom he furnished the
<i>Sparrow</i>, a small vessel sent to Plymouth on private account in
1622. Like Weston he had traded as an “interloper” to the Low
Countries from about 1612 to 1619. In the composition, Beauchamp
was one of the five chosen to receive payment of the settlement
money, and Sherley requested that he be joined with
him as agent or factor in London for the “Undertakers.” Another
New England colonial interest of his was the Muscongus
patent in which Edward Ashley served as agent in fur trade with
the Indians. The merchant also had a share in at least one ship
which received a commission to take pirates. About 1640 he was
judged to be not among the first, but the third, rank of citizens
able to contribute to the King’s financial needs. Beauchamp lent
money to various persons and apparently was rigorous in collection,
for even Sherley described him as “somewhat harsh,”
while a debtor’s widow, suing him, accused him of “unconscionably”
prosecuting her at law after her husband had discharged
his debt to him. This appears to be in character with
the attitude we shall see he assumed in the winding up of the
Pilgrims’ debts.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>James Sherley’s career is indeed the central one among the
London merchant supporters of the colony at Plymouth. In
December 1624, when he was thought to be fatally ill, his generosity
was called “the only glue of the company.” Without his
“unfeigned love” for the Pilgrims, his patience and willingness
to disregard the harsh judgments of the dissatisfied adventurers,
it was said that the project would have failed.</p>

<p>Sherley was apprenticed to his father, Robert Sherley, as a
goldsmith in 1604, and became a full member of the Goldsmiths’
Company in 1612. Like several other members of his family he
remained in close association with the Company throughout his
life, although it is clear that he did not follow the craft of making
plate or objects of gold and silver. Instead, he was in trade.
Yet he was first active in Company business through his collection
of Company rents, and he was chosen to take part in the
ceremonial occasions of the Goldsmiths. On Lord Mayor’s Day,
1633, attired in a rich livery gown “furred with Foynes,” Sherley
appeared at dinner at the Guildhall to “welcome the Lords
Ladies &amp; other guests.” On another occasion, before dining
with members of a neighboring company, he joined them in a
special service at St. Mary Woolnoth’s. Beginning with the office
of assistant, and refusing the third wardenship in 1639, he had
risen to the Company’s highest office, that of prime warden, by
1644. In this capacity he attended frequent wardens’ and court
meetings and presided over a complex amount of Company
business involving leases, loans, relations to the Mint, and other
matters. Goldsmiths’ Hall, in Foster Lane, was a busy center
for financial transactions.</p>

<p>Sherley’s own London address is something of a puzzle. Letters
were directed to him in 1623 both as “dwelling on London
bridge at the Golden hoospyte,” and to Crooked Lane. His
brother John had a shop on London Bridge; perhaps in early
years they shared a dwelling among the fine merchants’ houses
erected there. Crooked Lane was a winding artery in Candlewick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Ward, the site of a noted Dutch tavern; this may have been
where James Sherley maintained his business address. Like
many others who had left the stench, noise, and possible plague
of London, he later had a home in Clapham, Surrey, then a rural
environment. He wrote Bradford of carrying his records there
in 1636 when the plague was raging in London.</p>

<p>It was from Clapham that Sherley was chosen to serve in the
public capacities then filled by men of substance. He was a member
of the Surrey committee for levying assessments for the
militia. In confirmation of the strong religious tendency evident
in his correspondence with Bradford, he was an elder in the
Croydon Classis in Surrey, formed during a reorganization of
the English Church along Presbyterian lines. The New England
Company, erected to spread the Gospel to the Indians, included
him among its members. Parliament made him one of a Surrey
group appointed in 1652 to deal with the problem of supplying
proper ministers and schoolmasters in the churches of his
county. His son was granted the right to administer his will in
Clapham in 1657.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Early in his business career Sherley very likely was connected
with the Netherlands trade, for he was sufficiently friendly with
Edward Pickering, Weston’s agent, who died in 1623, to be one
of the executors of his will; in 1630 he wrote that he had spent
nearly three months in Holland. In underwriting the Plymouth
“Undertakers,” he perhaps was committed financially as deeply as
he could afford, for he did not join the Massachusetts Bay Company.
He did own ships in the New England trade, however, one
of which was hired by Isaac Allerton. He had a share in the
Ashley scheme in Maine and in voyages to Massachusetts Bay.
The latter colony owed him money in 1648.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Nothing has been discovered about the remaining adventurers
to alter the character of the group as described above; they were
chiefly Puritan merchants, possessed of substantial means but
not great wealth. It is true that Robert Alden, a prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
salter, at the opening of the Civil Wars adhered to the Royalist
minority of London citizens. William Greene, described as “one
of the most religious of the adventurers,” was among those
whose opposition to sending out any more emigrants from Leyden,
made him withdraw his support. Another, Thomas Brewer,
lumped together and imprisoned by the royal authorities with
Brownists, by 1640 had become Anabaptist, a sect not tolerated
by the Pilgrims.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> For the most part, however, a consistency of
business, religious, and political purposes seems to have prevailed
among those who closed out the Company of Adventurers
to New Plymouth.</p>

<span class="subhead">Plymouth Reorganizes Financially</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 id="sec_12">The colony looks to the fur trade to pay its debts</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1 firstword">The method</span> devised for repaying what was a stiff debt
for the young colony, as one writer puts it, “shows considerable
business ingenuity.” With ownership transferred
from London to Plymouth, the plantation became a virtual
corporation in fact. Two important matters still had to be decided.
Should all the settlers share in the disposition of the corporate
lands and assets and in the obligation of repayment to
the adventurers? How would they be able to guarantee satisfaction
of the London men? It was wisely decided to include as
holders of shares, or “purchasers,” all men, whatever their former
status, who were either heads of families or single and not
indentured servants. At the 1627 division of assets in the form of
land and cattle, every such person received twenty acres of tillable
land to add to the one-acre portion allotted him when the
plantation had ended the “common course.” The livestock was
parceled out for a time among twelve groups, a total of 156
individuals, with every six persons receiving one cow and two
goats. These “purchasers,” of whom in 1640 fifty-three were
listed as living in Plymouth and five in England, were to benefit
from subsequent divisions of land as the colony opened up.</p>

<p>The immediate task of paying the Londoners fell upon a
group of eight leaders, including William Bradford, Miles Standish,
Isaac Allerton, Edward Winslow, William Brewster, John
Howland, John Alden, and Thomas Prence, known as the “Undertakers.”
These men founded a partnership to manage the fur
trade of the colony for six years, the time during which the returns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
from the Pilgrims’ most profitable business enterprise were
to be devoted to paying the debt and importing essential English
goods. This became the business of the eight who took possession
at once of the company boats and “the whole stock of furs,
fells, beads, corn, wampampeak, hatchets, knives, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>It may be asked why the “Undertakers” were willing to saddle
themselves with such a responsibility. The answer is their sense
of obligation to their old friends in Leyden, as well as their
fidelity to the London merchants. Most of the former adventurers
had so opposed sending over any more people from Leyden that
the beloved Pastor Robinson prophetically, before his death,
looked for no further help until means came from Plymouth itself.
The first example of such aid would cost the partnership
£500, the amount paid for the emigration in 1629 of what was a
welcome but “weak” addition to the colony.</p>

<h3 id="sec_13">Three London merchants agree to continue as Plymouth’s partners</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It was</span> extremely important to tap resources of English credit
to secure new working capital for the trade. It might have to be
borrowed at rates as high as 30–50%, instead of the 6–8%
Sherley reported as current for English business loans in 1628.
This explains why Allerton was sent to London to persuade the
former treasurer of the company, Sherley, and others in England
to join the “Undertakers” as partners. Together with
Sherley, John Beauchamp and Richard Andrews consented to
the proposal. One immediate result was that Sherley forebore
collection of £50 he had lent at 30% two years earlier, and induced
John Beauchamp and Richard Andrews to do the same
for goods they had provided while the negotiations were in
progress. At Bradford’s request, Sherley and Beauchamp were
designated as factors to receive the furs shipped to London,
while Allerton, long since Bradford’s right hand as chief of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
assistants in the colony, continued to act as business agent of
the “Undertakers.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_14">The Pilgrims encounter difficulties in the fur trade</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Under </span>skillful and energetic management the Plymouth traders
soon succeeded in expanding their collection of pelts from
the Indians. The trade in furs had begun in 1621, when Squanto
guided the Pilgrims’ shallop to the Massachusetts Indians. Unluckily,
the first return to England of two hogsheads, estimated
to be worth about £400, was captured in the <i>Fortune</i>. In fact, a
considerable quantity of what was collected in the first years
never reached England at all and thus produced no credit for
the colony. Instead, Weston’s malice was all they got for 170
pounds of beaver lent him on his arrival in 1623. Another part
of their precious hoard of skins paid some fishermen for raising
the <i>Little James</i>, while Turkish pirates seized an additional 800
pounds on its way to England in 1625. Finally, the colony purchased
with beaver about £500 worth of trading goods, including
Biscay rugs, from a wrecked ship they learned was for sale
at Monhegan.</p>

<p>After the joint stock company had broken up, Standish took
£277 worth of beaver with him to pay Sherley. A large haul of
700 pounds was the result of a single autumn voyage to the
Kennebec, purchased, remarkably enough, with home-grown
corn. No lack of energy on the part of the Plymouth traders
had prevented returns, but scarcity of the kind of English trading
goods, such as hatchets, knives, and trading cloth, which
the Indians wanted. In the early stages such goods had to be
bought from passing vessels. On at least one occasion valuable
coat beaver, which Bradford expected to bring about 20s. per
pound in England, was sold to these at 3s. a pound, in exchange
for beads and knives.</p>

<p>As the “Undertakers” took over management, it was evident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
that numerous competing trading posts, settled up and down
the New England coast, were beginning to cut into Plymouth’s
sources of fur and to raise the price the Indians demanded for
it. The scapegrace, Thomas Morton of Merrymount, in particular,
aroused their ire by selling the natives the forbidden articles,
liquor, guns, and powder. On top of this, his introduction of
such pastimes as setting up a May Pole and “drinking and ...
dancing and frisking together” with Indian maidens so seriously
offended their religious sensibilities that they sent Captain Standish
to evict Morton in 1628.</p>

<p>In the early stages of the fur trade, transportation presented
considerable difficulty. Shallops or open boats were used at first,
but a small vessel was needed to coast in and out of the little harbors
for several weeks at a time, carrying a few traders and their
supplies. To provide for this, an ingenious house carpenter
lengthened one of the shallops and built a deck, affording a hold
for long voyages in the winter.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The “Undertakers” now decided to build a pinnace on the
Manomet River, twenty miles south of Plymouth, and to erect
there a permanent trading house of hewn oak planks, furnished
with trading goods and in the care of two men the year round.
Aptucxet was the name of their first post; it was located so
strategically in relation to Buzzard’s Bay that its site is at the
edge of the modern passage, the Cape Cod Canal. In the seventeenth
century a short overland portage, probably accomplished
in about six hours, took one across the neck of the Cape from a
few miles up the Scusset River, entered from Cape Cod Bay,
and thus avoided the hazards of sea passage around the Cape.</p>

<p>Just at this time the Pilgrims took advantage of a new contact.
Responding to earlier Dutch offers to trade for beaver, Governor
Bradford invited Isaack de Rasieres, the chief merchant in New
Amsterdam, to pay a visit. The portly burgher arrived at the
Aptucxet post in October 1627 and came ashore “accompanied
with a noise of trumpeters.” Finding the journey overland to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
Plymouth too far to walk, he requested that a small boat be sent
for him, visited the little town, and in due course wrote a description
of it. The intercourse thus opened with the Dutch
plantation at the mouth of the Hudson lasted several years. It
not only offered the Pilgrims desirable goods, such as sugar,
linen cloth, and other stuffs, but in the long run greatly enhanced
the colony’s opportunities for Indian trade by selling
them a quantity of wampum. This valuable native shell money,
made by the Narragansetts, now promoted gainful dealings with
the Abnakis of the Kennebec country and other tribes. De
Rasieres felt it necessary to justify his selling the Pilgrims the
first fifty fathom of sewan (wampum) by saying that he hoped to
keep them from seeking it themselves at its source of manufacture
and so discovering the profitable fur trade inland. He must
have meant by this the trade with the Iroquois the Dutch had
tapped through their control of the Hudson River, or that of the
upper Connecticut Valley.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_15">Plymouth obtains a new patent to protect its trading rights</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The </span>rival shipmasters and settlers now ranging along the rocky
coves and inlets of the Maine coast alarmed Plymouth lest they
take control of the mouth of the Kennebec River. Since the
autumn of 1625, most of the beaver collected had been furnished
by the Abnaki Indians of this region. To secure this area and
to define the boundaries of the colony, which had been unspecified
in the Peirce patent, Isaac Allerton was directed to
seek a new patent from the Council for New England. Some
money was laid out for this purpose in his accounts with Sherley
in 1628. The first grant he obtained proved to be so “strait
and ill bounded,” however, that he had to apply for its enlargement.
Sherley reported that Allerton was “so turmoiled about
it” that he would not have undertaken such trouble, even for a
thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>The fruit of these efforts was a patent the Council issued in
1630, signed by the Earl of Warwick. It gave Plymouth not only
its first exact boundaries, but a strip of land along the Kennebec,
with control of fifteen miles on either side of the river, running
up the river as far as the site of Cushenoc or present-day Augusta,
Maine. This document, in the name of William Bradford and
his associates, the first of their grants reflecting the complete
shift in ownership from London to the New World, provided the
basis for the colony’s land rights. At the same time Allerton did
not succeed in getting past the seals a charter from the King,
such as Massachusetts Bay had. He was criticized for this, somewhat
unjustly, on the grounds that he failed because he and Sherley
included among its terms some special customs privileges.
Yet several charters, notably that of Massachusetts Bay, carried
privileges similar to those Allerton requested, so it is more likely
that a lack of funds and influence at court blocked passage. Allerton
had apparently influenced Sherley to persuade Bradford that
this charter could be secured only if he was allowed to go back to
England. In fact, nothing more came of it, although £500 was
reported to have been spent on the patent.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_16">Plymouth’s business agent is dismissed for a “conflict of interest”</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Until </span>this time everyone had relied on Allerton; now the “Undertakers”
began to look on their business agent with disfavor.
His previous long record of helpfulness had caused them to disregard
the grumblings of the new settlers from Leyden, who
were dissatisfied with his treatment of them. Allerton had belonged
to the original Leyden congregation and had helped advise
Carver and Cushman about preparations for the voyage to
America, had signed the Mayflower Compact, and had assisted
Governor Bradford after Carver’s death. As a member of the
governing circle and a trusted official, he completed negotiation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
of the dissolution of the merchant adventurers for New Plymouth
during trips to London in 1626–27. Quite naturally, Sherley’s
praise of him as an “honest and discreet agent” bolstered
the colony’s belief in his “good and faithful service.”</p>

<p>While this enterprising man began his mission without deliberately
dishonest intent, he expected successfully to combine
with it the pursuit of his own private interests. He soon joined
Sherley in a private arrangement, for in 1628 the London man
referred to an “account betwixt you and me,” which was separate
from Allerton’s purchases for Plymouth. There it was
known and accepted that he brought over some goods “upon
his own particular, and sold them for his own ... benefit.” His
frequent journeys to England and the intimate knowledge he
had of the needs of New England obviously gave him special
opportunities. One of these was to buy provisions for the settlers
of Massachusetts Bay, a contract perhaps dating from a visit he
made aboard the ship carrying John Winthrop to New England
in 1630. Emmanuel Downing and John Humfrey, two leading
supporters in London of the Bay colony, thought highly of his
advice that they move this plantation to the Hudson River.
Allerton’s relation with the Bay leaders outlasted those with
the Pilgrims.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Plymouth’s agent nonetheless revealed an indifference to her
wishes when he brought back from England the very same
Thomas Morton whom she had expelled. It was an insult to shelter
this man right on the main street and even to employ him
for a short time as a business secretary. Then, too, while buying
a much bigger quantity of goods to be sold to the settlers than
instructed, Allerton neglected to secure proper supplies of
trading goods. Sherley had pressured him into exceeding the
small quotas ordered by the “Undertakers,” he said in his defense.
Sherley’s letters did stress, of course, the need to turn
over as large an amount as possible during the relatively short
duration of the partnership’s monopoly of trade, arguing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
a large outlay was required to make a good profit in so short a
time. “... we must follow it roundly and to purpose, for if we
piddle out the time in our trade, others will step in and nose
us....” Bradford and the others, understandably, were much
more anxious to pay off the debts already owed than to overextend
themselves just to make a profit.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Such disagreements between Allerton and Sherley on the one
hand, and Bradford, Winslow, and others at Plymouth, multiplied
as the result of a new Maine venture, devised in 1629,
which rivaled the Kennebec. Sherley and three other Londoners
sent Edward Ashley, a keen trader but “a profane young man”
by Pilgrim standards, to found a rival post at Pentagoet, near
the Penobscot River. Allerton had refused to commit the Plymouth
partners to the scheme without their consent, but on the
basis of later correspondence Bradford decided that he had been
an instigator of the plan. Since they had to send Ashley supplies,
the Pilgrims had little choice anyway but to come in, if they
wished to have some control of this potential competitor. Ashley
soon was better supplied with trading goods than Plymouth,
which, indeed, had to buy from Allerton himself, in return for
part of their beaver taken at reduced prices. Without their knowledge,
their versatile agent next borrowed money on their account
at Bristol, at 50% interest, ostensibly so that goods might be
shipped early with the fishing fleet headed for New England
waters in the spring of the year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Winslow had conceived a plan to send a fishing
ship laden with trading goods from the West Country in England
directly to Maine, where a cargo of salt purchased the season
before would await the ship’s arrival. In fact, the vessel thus
hired, the <i>Friendship</i>, was badly delayed by “foul weather” so
that Allerton reached Maine, traveling on the <i>White Angel</i>, only
just before Timothy Hatherley, one of the London associates,
finally reached Boston in the <i>Friendship</i>. The latter revealed that
most of the goods he carried were not for Plymouth at all, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
for Massachusetts. Plymouth’s mounting annoyance and mistrust
of Allerton reached its pinnacle with the disturbing revelation
that the English partners had bought outright the <i>White
Angel</i>, not merely hired her, as was customary. The “Undertakers”
suddenly were confronted by fresh, crushing debts, for
each English partner had contributed two or three times as
large an investment as before. Meanwhile, with a subtle note of
mistrust of Plymouth’s dealings with them, the latter had designated
Hatherley as a confidential agent to be informed of “the
state and account of all the business.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Thus commenced a new and tedious financial wrangle between
Plymouth and London. The former felt that the necessary
control of their own business and obligations ceased when the
English members could “run into such great things, and charge
of shipping and new projects in their own heads, not only without
but against all order and advice....” Confronted by their
objections, Allerton undertook to convince them that they need
not have the <i>White Angel</i> on the general account, if they did not
wish to. Years later, in 1639, he testified that he had bought her
at Bristol in 1631 only for the inner group comprising himself,
Sherley, Andrews, and Beauchamp, and even Hatherley, whereas
the <i>Friendship</i> was hired for all the partners of Plymouth.
London contradicted this, saying that the ship would not have
been purchased at all, if it hadn’t been for the interests of
Plymouth.</p>

<p>The disagreement over the <i>White Angel</i> and the <i>Friendship</i>
plagued the partnership for some time to come, but the leaders
on both sides of the Atlantic now concurred in the dismissal of
Allerton as agent. Hatherley’s tour of inspection of the “down
east” trading posts before his return to London demonstrated
to him that “Allerton played his own game and ran a course not
only to the great wrong and detriment of the Plantation who
employed and trusted him, but abused them ... in possessing
them [in England] with prejudice against the Plantation ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that they would never be able to repay their moneys....” Winslow,
one of the most enterprising traders among the “Undertakers,”
had journeyed to London earlier in 1631 and succeeded
the discredited agent.</p>

<p>Should Allerton flatly be called a cheat? Unable to “be brief
in so tedious and intricate a business,” Bradford himself struggled
not to impute to Allerton thoroughly dishonest motives.
The Governor even admitted that the agent’s commission to act
in Plymouth’s behalf had given him a certain freedom of action.
That Allerton had been led aside from the main desires of the
Plantation by “his own gains and private ends,” we conclude
from his managing to invest £400 under Sherley’s name in the
brewhouse belonging to one of the former London adventurers,
William Collier. Bradford became convinced that the agent had
inspired both the schemes of Ashley’s rival trade and the purchase
of the <i>White Angel</i>, persuading his London friends that
the Kennebec trade alone was insufficient to pay them.</p>

<p>The partnership’s general account thus became simply a convenient
place for Allerton to unload losses, with records “so
large and intricate, as they could not well understand them,
much less examine and correct them without a great deal of
time and help....” His lists of all sorts of expenses took advantage
of the Pilgrims’ weakness with accounts: “£30 given at a
clap, and £50 spent in a journey.... Yea, he screwed up his
poor old father-in-law’s [Elder Brewster] account to above £200
and brought it upon the general account ... because he knew
they would never let it lie on the old man....” Puzzled, Bradford
admitted that he did not know “how it came to pass, or
what mystery was in it,” that Allerton even was able to present
a list of all “disbursements,” though it was Sherley who made
them during his own absence. In the final calculations a sizable
discrepancy (£2300) arose. Whereas the agent claimed the
partners owed him £300, the latter represented his debt to
them as £2000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>When Sherley wrote that “if their business had been better
managed they might have been the richest plantation of any
English at that time,” he could blame the financial incompetence
of the “Undertakers” at Plymouth as well as Allerton’s deficiencies.
Their initial trust in the honesty of others, however praiseworthy,
was no match for the shrewdness of the businessmen
who soon were to make Boston and the Bay colony the center of
trade in New England. Consider how they accepted their associate
Hatherley’s unauthorized “honest word” that they would be
discharged from the <i>Friendship</i>’s account, thus permitting
Allerton and him to collect all its returns, even though they
paid the Pilgrims only £200. Then, after Hatherley’s London
partners repudiated this discharge, the Pilgrims were billed for
losses, but with no countervailing credits. “... they were ...
now taught how to deal in the world, especially with merchants,
in such cases,” Bradford sadly noted in comment, but the lesson
unfortunately did not improve their keeping of accounts.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Without a single surviving letter of Allerton’s, stating his
point of view about the Pilgrims, it is difficult to judge his career.
We know that as a busy merchant and projector he continued to
shuttle back and forth across the Atlantic and up and down the
American coast from northern Maine to New Amsterdam. His
own ventures in the <i>White Angel</i>, which he hired and later
bought from Sherley, turned out badly, but the fault of placing
part of its debts on Plymouth’s account seems to have been
Sherley’s. Allerton set up a rival post at Machias, Maine, “to
run into every hole and into the river of the Kennebec to glean
away the trade ... there”; after its capture by the French, his
pinnace traded in the Penobscot region. During a season of
fishing at Marblehead for Matthew Cradock, a London promoter
of the Massachusetts Bay Company, Allerton nevertheless continued
to be named an assistant of the Plymouth colony and was
a freeman there as late as 1637. In 1633 he was the richest man
in Plymouth; he lent large sums of money to other settlers, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
his sister’s husband. Merchants of Massachusetts and
New Netherland did not distrust him, even though Winslow
wrote from England in 1637 to warn Governor Winthrop of
Massachusetts that Allerton was too friendly with “our common
adversaries,” those who were thinking of securing a royal commission
to govern all of New England. He wrote: “... the truth
is he loveth neither you nor us.”</p>

<p>The former agent was, in fact, primarily a businessman, without
strong religious or sentimental ties. He certainly “abused”
the trust of his old comrades by saddling them with such heavy
debts, but his acts seem unscrupulous rather than calculated
dishonesty. He took risks which, if they turned out badly, hurt
other people. In short, this maker of “fair propositions and
large promises” was led into temptation by dreams of wealth;
in this he was like many another promoter. Ultimately, his bad
judgment and ill luck brought him losses, and he died insolvent
in New Haven in 1659.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_17">The colony and its London partners dispute over their accounts</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The stresses</span> between the “Undertakers” and the London
partners were not relieved simply by Allerton’s dismissal. A
decade of acrimonious exchange of letters followed from 1631
to 1641. It was not easy for the Londoners to balance off Allerton’s
debts, along with new expenses, against the receipt of furs
shipped from Plymouth. They were determined to hold out
until a settlement profitable to them was reached. Throughout
this quarrel Bradford’s <cite>History</cite> has to be our guide for the most
part, for only one fragment of reckoning between Sherley and
Allerton has been found. Undoubtedly, when the great governor
wrote his narrative he was trying to rehabilitate the Pilgrims’
financial reputation and counter the rumors in London and
Boston mercantile circles that they were in default. In his chapters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
on finance he is repetitious, sometimes confusing, and yet
omits certain business details. His judgment was charitable,
however, and by recording Sherley’s letters he preserved at
least some of London’s side of the controversy.</p>

<p>The first dispute arose from Edward Winslow’s unwillingness
to accept the <i>White Angel</i>’s losses on the “Undertakers’” account.
Sherley was displeased and warned that this “unreasonable
refusal” might “hasten that fire which is a kindling too fast
already....” Plymouth nonetheless declined to take on all the
debts which appeared in Sherley’s accounting of 1631. It was
found that in arriving at a total of £4770, in addition to £1000
unpaid of the purchase money, he had charged twice and even
three times for certain items. £600 of this amount even Allerton
could not identify.</p>

<p>The London partners’ dissatisfaction with the records kept
in Plymouth led Sherley to insist on the appointment of Josiah
Winslow, younger brother of Edward, as their accountant. The
Pilgrims remarked crustily “that if they were well dealt with
and had their goods well sent over, they could keep their accounts
... themselves.” Certainly, the new accountant, with
his hopeless inaccuracy and carelessness, did little to mend
matters. In fact, he “did wholly fail them, and could never give
them any account; but trusting to his memory and loose papers,
let things run into such confusion that neither he, nor any with
him, could bring things to rights.” Ultimately, they lost several
hundreds of pounds in this way for goods trusted out without
any record clear enough to call in the payments. Also, goods
arrived from England without prices or invoices.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several circumstances fed Plymouth’s dissatisfaction
with James Sherley, including his continuing to do business
with Allerton. After selling the latter the controversial ship,
Sherley nevertheless could write with unctious fervor, “Oh the
grief and trouble that man, Mr. Allerton, hath brought upon
you and us! I cannot forget it, and to think on it draws many a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
sigh from my heart and tears from my eyes.” Yet he rescued
Allerton from trouble with his ship, sent Plymouth’s supply on
board it in 1632, and allowed him easy terms. It was hard to
reconcile Sherley’s depressing complaints about his own heavy
debts with this extension of credit to Allerton and participation
in other ventures, such as sending Captain William Peirce to
Massachusetts Bay. Unfortunately, Peirce’s ship met disaster on
her way home in 1632, so the beaver that Plymouth had entrusted
to her, along with some of their accounts, was “swallowd
up in the sea.”</p>

<p>By 1636 Bradford reckoned that Plymouth had sent to England
about 12,530 pounds of beaver estimated to be worth more
than £10,000, with 1,156 otter skins to pay the freight charges.
Because of Winslow’s shaky accounts, they could only estimate
the receipts of English goods. They thought these cost about
£2000, and even if the debt of £4770 was increased, they could
not understand why the fur receipts would not have more than
paid it off. One explanation probably is that Sherley was unable
to sell all of the beaver at the high prices they had counted
on. During the plague year of 1636 he complained that prices
dropped to 8s. a pound. Also, Sherley was unable to determine
just how many skins belonged to the “Undertakers’” account,
and how many Winslow had bought from settlers who had no
part in the “Undertakers’” scheme.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h3 id="sec_18">The London partners quarrel among themselves</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">To the</span> problem of extricating the Plymouth venture from its
financial straits a new one was now added. A quarrel had broken
out among the English partners themselves, James Sherley, John
Beauchamp, and Richard Andrews. These men had shared in
the debts incurred after 1626 to keep Plymouth supplied. The
Pilgrims had expected all three to profit from the large quantities
of furs shipped after 1631. Instead, in 1640 Beauchamp and Andrews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
revealed a rift with Sherley of several years standing. They
complained in court that they had not received a fair share of the
returns on their investment and tried to force a full accounting
of Sherley’s transactions with Plymouth. This suit, with its contradictory
sets of figures, exposed the nature of their association.</p>

<p>In the joint adventure to trade with the Governor and the
rest of the Plymouth “Undertakers,” each of the three Londoners
had promised to put £1100 into stock. Richard Andrews
paid in £1136, John Beauchamp £1127, and, they claimed,
James Sherley pretended to put in £1190 (a total of about
£3500). To meet pressing debts about 1636 Beauchamp contributed
£500 more. It was expected that Sherley, acting as
sole factor, would dispose of returns from the plantation, report
occasionally to them, and distribute any profits. In a few years,
they asserted, he handled beaver and otter worth from £12,000
to £13,000 but ignored their requests to show his accounts; thus
they had no way of checking whether he had used some of the
profits for his own business. He had exhibited “a covetous
disposition to gain ... [their dues] himself ...” and to their
“loving” pleas replied violently that he would rot and die before
giving an account. They suspected him of withdrawing his own
stock and profits.</p>

<p>How did Sherley answer these charges? First, he denied that
Andrews was a party to the suit, since before going abroad, he
had told Sherley of Beauchamp’s plan to sue and refused to join
in it. Not he, but Allerton, had been the “Undertakers’” agent,
accredited to buy and sell; he acted only in Allerton’s absence,
although permitting his warehouse in London to be used for
Plymouth’s goods. In 1632 he had given Edward Winslow
copies of all his receipts and payments. Since the chief function
of all three London merchants had consisted of making good
Allerton’s demands for credit for Plymouth, they had laid out
sizable sums of money, urged on by hope of preventing loss of
what they had already invested. Sherley alone found himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
“out of purse” some £1866 in March 1631/32. If he was able
to collect £675 owed to Plymouth, this still left him with £1190
tied up in their enterprise. The debts of the London men, on
Plymouth’s behalf, ran up to £5900 in 1631, but Sherley had
been paying these off slowly, as the planters’ returns trickled in.
Indeed, had it not been for his own “deep engagements” and
his partners’ “earnest request,” Sherley protested, he would
have given up the business long before. He was not obliged to
give a detailed accounting to his copartners, but only to the
Plymouth associates. Actually, it was up to the latter to produce
an exact accounting to the three London men, not the other way
about. Sherley was anxious to reconcile his accounts with them
and was willing to meet their agent even in France or Holland;
until then, he could not even “book” (enter) the items for
which he had loose records.</p>

<p>Sherley insisted that he had sold no furs for his own profit,
but had informed Beauchamp and Andrews when he disposed
of any. In a final balance of all records he was sure that Plymouth
would still owe him money, not he owe his copartners,
for the latter had adventured absolutely nothing since 1631.
He, not they, had carried the burden in London in the “sickly”
years of 1635 and 1636. With this defense, Bradford says,
Beauchamp and Andrews failed to win the suit,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and indeed,
Sherley’s letters confirm that his credit was sorely taxed in the
1630s.</p>

<h3 id="sec_19">Through arbiters, Plymouth and London reach a financial settlement</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">While </span>this dispute was in progress, however, the Pilgrims
were so perplexed about its rights that they were persuaded to
send 1,325 pounds of beaver directly to the other two partners,
hoping to satisfy their claims that Sherley had paid them
nothing. After selling it, Beauchamp chalked off £400 of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
debt, but Andrews, through mismanagement, sold his at a loss
and in 1642 still claimed between £500 and £600. He finally
agreed to accept payment in cattle to Governor John Winthrop
of Massachusetts Bay and designated the “godly poor men”
and “poor ministers” of that colony as the beneficiaries of
Plymouth’s debt. In addition, Andrews and Beauchamp received
land in Scituate, one of several flourishing daughter
towns now settled in Plymouth.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the business with Sherley was wound up at last.
Trade with him had already broken off because of distrust of
his repeated delays in accounting to his London partners. For
fear of legal reprisals from any of these, it was decided not to
risk sending another agent to London but to have some “gentlemen
and merchants in the Bay” hear the dispute. Even “though
it should cost them all they had in the world,” the “Undertakers”
promised to accept their award. This decision was
prompted by two considerations. First, they feared that the
price of cattle, by now a greater source of income than furs,
might drop and change their circumstances. Also, the colony’s
founders, surviving into old age, wished to clear up their affairs
before death overtook them. Sherley himself believed that lawyers
would be “the most gainers” from legal action, and therefore
selected John Atwood and William Collier, recent merchant
arrivals in Plymouth from London, to draw up a composition.
Another participant in the settlement was Edmund Freeman,
Beauchamp’s brother-in-law, and now the leading citizen of
Sandwich. After laborious days of investigation of accounts,
they estimated everything left in Plymouth of the old stock,
housing, boats, the bark and goods for the Indian trade, and “all
debts, as well those that were desperate, as others more hopeful,”
at £1400.</p>

<p>By October 15, 1641, Atwood, Bradford, and Edward Winslow
had come to terms ending the partnership. The agreement
of 1627 was reacknowledged, but Plymouth, while admitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
confusion in Josiah Winslow’s bookkeeping, again repudiated
the debts of the <i>White Angel</i> and the <i>Friendship</i>. A full discharge
from the obligations of the beaver trade, the charges of
the two ships, and the £1800 purchase money agreed on in
1627 was promised by Atwood in behalf of the London associates.
Bradford and his partners for their part guaranteed payment
to them of £1400. £110 of this had already been paid to
Winthrop for Andrews’ account, and eighty pounds of beaver
to Atwood. The rest was to be discharged in appropriate commodities,
at the rate of £200 per year.</p>

<h3 id="sec_20">1645—Plymouth’s debts “hopeful and desperate” at last are discharged</h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">To execute</span> this agreement across the distance of the broad
Atlantic took some time. Recognizing the justness of the “Undertakers’”
final account but calling the venture “uncomfortable
and unprofitable to all,” James Sherley signed the release
in June 1642. In the bargaining, the Reverend Hugh Peter,
Thomas Weld, and William Hibbins, in England as agents of
Massachusetts, put forth Atwood’s terms. At the same time they
succeeded in persuading the London partners to surrender for
charitable purposes in New England the £1200 debt. Three
quarters, or £900, was set apart for Massachusetts, while Plymouth
was to receive only £300.</p>

<p>A letter of Richard Andrews about this time fortunately permits
us to break away from the divergent points of view set
forth in Bradford’s narrative and Sherley’s letters. In many
ways Andrews was the most straightforward of the London
partners and the most generous. While forgiving the interest
due on his own account, he charged that Sherley and Beauchamp
had “wronged [the business] many £100 both in principal
and interest” and knowingly presented unfair accounts.
This remark suggests one solution to the problem as to why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
seemingly excessive charges on the Pilgrims mounted year after
year in spite of their returns. Hinting that Sherley had manipulated
some private losses so as to place them on the general account,
Andrews perhaps did not recognize the rapidity with
which the debts accumulated because of the high rates of interest
on them. The fact is that colonial ventures were considered
such poor financial risks that their debts tended to multiply
faster than they could be paid off. This explanation of their
financial plight is probably closer to the truth than that the Londoners
deliberately perpetrated a “manifest fraud” upon the
plantation. It was Andrews also who echoed the complaint common
to all the London merchants engaged in colonial enterprise.
He wrote in 1645 that the conduct of the “Undertakers” did not
become “fair dealing men who make not so much profession to
walk according to the rule of the gospel as they.... I hope that
seven years time is long enough to keep my money before they
return the principal....”</p>

<p>John Beauchamp, unlike the more generous Andrews, continued
to insist on collecting his debt even though it could never
be proved. To settle this claim, Bradford and his partners in
1645 turned over to his attorney houses and lands in Plymouth,
Rehoboth, and Marshfield worth £291.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It is to Plymouth’s credit that all these obligations were met
in the 1640s, because the colony was no longer as prosperous
as in the preceding decade. Its wealth had come to consist increasingly
of cattle, so that the price collapse which took place
when the influx of new settlers into the Bay ceased, came
suddenly and with severe effect. Cattle came to be worth perhaps
25% of its former value. Even the wealthier colony of
Massachusetts discovered that it could no longer secure credit
in England. The Pilgrims nevertheless continued to develop
their modest resources in animal stock and land. A new land
arrangement reflected the ending of the old debts. Governor
Bradford, who had held title to the patent since 1630, along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
with the “old comers” or “purchasers,” turned over the grant
to the whole body of freemen of Plymouth, retaining for himself
only three reserved tracts as his reward for carrying the responsibility
for repayment.</p>

<p>As to Plymouth’s fur trade, the complaint John Winthrop
had once voiced that the colony had “engrossed all the chief
places of trade” in New England was no longer true. The “Old
Colony” had been edged out of the Connecticut River and
Narragansett trade, some of its Maine posts had been attacked
by the French, and rival settlers and competitors had made the
rest less profitable. At Aptucxet commerce with the Dutch kept
on for a time, and on the Kennebec there remained an echo of
the busy activity of the 1630s. A small group farmed the Indian
trade there so that at his death in 1657 Bradford’s stock of trading
goods and debts due from it was worth £256. Within a few
years, however, all trading goods were brought home and the
Kennebec tract sold.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Thus ended the history of Plymouth Colony as a business
venture. Even after careful study of all the details we know, it is
hard to interpret and correctly assess whether the London
capitalists or the colony can really be blamed for the contradictory
financial muddle. In their somewhat uneasy alliance, the
Londoners with spare funds and the group of obscure artisans
and small farmers, mostly dissenters from the established
church, no doubt emphasized different goals. Most of the merchants,
while Puritan in religious sympathies, nevertheless
anticipated profits. This appeared to them fitting, since they
risked great loss in so untried a speculation. Then, after Plymouth
was settled and valuable returns established, the Londoners
held an advantage to the end, for they were always in a
creditor position as they continued to supply essential goods at
high prices and rates of interest. The colonists’ payment was
slow, interrupted by many misfortunes and contingencies, but
eventually it was made. Although the investors in the original<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
company lost most of their money, the businessmen who stayed
with the enterprise, such as Sherley, seem to have increased
their capital.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims, too, achieved success, for they had built the
essentials of a free and self-sustaining community. If they were
never wealthy in their new environment, the leaders of Plymouth,
developing business experience and judgment, by 1645
enjoyed modest prosperity. They had paid off the expenses of
shipping over their fellow exiles from Leyden and bought the
livestock and equipment needed as the foundation for settlement.
Ignorance, desertion by their first backers, cruel losses at
sea, their agent’s misdeeds, all had been overcome. They were
now rid of the burdens inherent in the London merchants’
sponsorship of the colony. Their debts, both “hopeful and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>desperate,” lay behind.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> To identify John Beauchamp is particularly difficult. Ford has
him as the son of Thomas Beauchamp of Cosgrave, Nottinghamshire.
Using the same reference cited by him (<cite>Visitation of London, 1633–35</cite>,
59), I read it as Cosgrave, Northamptonshire. His marriage to Alice
Freeman, whose brother, Edmund Freeman, acted as Beauchamp’s attorney
in Plymouth in 1641, seems to establish him as the right Beauchamp.
See Bradford, <cite>History</cite>, ed. Ford, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 296n. Beaven makes John
Beauchamp, Salter, Alderman for Billingsgate Ward in 1651, and gives
as his will a reference to a John Beauchamp of the parish of St. Giles
Cripplegate Without (Beaven, <cite>Aldermen of London</cite>, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 75; P.C.C. Hene
[1668]), who left as heirs no wife or children, whereas the John Beauchamp
connected with Plymouth had several sons and daughters. This
will must be that of another man. In 1649 and after, a John Beauchamp
of Surrey appeared in the same committees as James Sherley and Edward
Winslow, such as those for collecting the army assessment or to
sell goods from the estate of Charles <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, <i>A.O.I., 1642–60</i>, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 44, 160, 310,

because he was living in Clapham, James Sherley is not listed
among those who paid poll money to the Commissioners. A duty of the
prime warden, with his second and third wardens, was to have custody
of the plate belonging to the City of London, <cite>ibid.</cite>, 238. In 1652 Sherley
was appointed with other wardens to prepare an answer to a petition by
the freemen of the Company to a committee of Parliament concerning
their rights in choosing the wardens, Sir Walter S. Prideaux, <cite>Memorials
of the Goldsmiths’ Company</cite> ... (London, 1896), <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 24.</p>

<p>Of the several James Sherleys who are contemporaries, I have concluded
that the James Sherley, third son of Robert Sherley, originally
of Wistonston, was the one involved with the Plymouth venture. The
other James Sherleys in this family are (1) the eldest son of John Sherley
of London, and (2) the elder son of James Sherley, son of Robert. See
<cite>Visitation of London, 1633–35</cite>, <span class="allsmcap">II</span>, 235–236. It is difficult to determine
whether the James Sherley, merchant, who owned houses in London in
1637 is the same, “Returns of Divided Houses in the City of London,
1637,” 208. The one who appeared with Robert Sherley to turn over
property to Robert’s daughter, Sara, in 1632 is our man, P.R.O., C.
54/2950; see also <cite>Registers of St. Vedast, Foster Lane</cite> (Harl. Soc., 1902)

<p>“Foynes” or foins were originally fur of the weasel family, or more
generally, furs.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
